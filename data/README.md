# Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs

This is the first year the Census Bureau has released these data sets. What's new and different about this data is info about businesses age (years in operation).

Data and more info available here: http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ase/data/tables.html

# Quality

The nitty-gritty data, such as the number of businesses owned by a specific minority group in a very small state like Connecticut,  should probably not be used or should at least be viewed with a great deal of skepticism. They have really high margins of error. The broader categories are significantly better.
