Statistics for U.S. Employer Firms by Sector, Gender, Ethnicity, Race, Veteran Status, and Receipts Size of Firm for the U.S., States, and Top 50 MSAs: 2014

Release Date : 08/26/2016

[NOTE: Includes firms with payroll at any time during 2014. Employment reflects the number of paid employees during the March 12 pay period. Data are based on Census administrative records, and the estimates of business ownership by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status are from the 2014 Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs. Detail may not add to total due to rounding or because a Hispanic firm may be of any race. Moreover, each owner had the option of selecting more than one race and therefore is included in each race selected. Firms with more than one domestic establishment are counted in each geographic area and industry in which they operate, but only once in the U.S. and state totals for all sectors. For information on confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, see Survey Methodology.]
